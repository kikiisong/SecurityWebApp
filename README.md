# Security Web Application
## Application Background
Public safety has always been a concern for citizens, especially for those who live in bad neighborhoods.
We aim to provide users a precise way to view, report and be notified of security incidents. Our intended audience would mainly be Baltimore citizens, especially JHU students and faculty.
## Final Expected Functions
A security alert web app where users can view, score and report incidents in near neighborhoods. The app will also have social functions which allows users to discuss incidents and provide support to each other.
## How To Run It 
1. Switch to main branch and clone the repo to local. 
2. Go to SecurityApp > src > main > java > Server.java .
3. Run Server.java locally.
4. Use your installed browser to open "localhost:7000", you should be redirected to the user interface of the application.
5. Click on "Report Incident" (If you are having trouble clicking it, scroll the page to the bottom, and click the bottom part of this button) and fill out the "Address" (e.g. carey business school).
6. Click "Submit"!
7. Marker will be displayed on the map, once the incident is successfully submitted.
8. Go to "Incident History" from the Navigation Bar to see the reported incident.
9. Go to "Contact" from the Navigation Bar to see the contact details of The office of Campus Security.
